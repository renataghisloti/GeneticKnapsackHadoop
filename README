Genetic Algorithm to run on Hadoop. I used as example the optimization Knapsack Problem.

To execute this program, it is necessary to have a Hadoop cluster working.

Setting up the Hadoop Cluster for testing on a sinlge machine:

Download hadoop 1.21 from:

http://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html

Install a Java 6:

$ sudo apt-get install oracle-java6-installer

Inside the hadoop home directory, update a configuration file in  conf/ :

$ vim conf/hadoop-env.sh 

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/ 
export HADOOP_HOME=/home/renata/hadoop-1.2.1 
export HADOOP_VERSION=1.2.1 

Create an input directory, to place your input file: 

$ mkdir input 

Put some content in:

$ cp conf/*.xml input 

To test if your hadoop is working properly:

$ bin/hadoop jar hadoop-examples*.jar grep input output 'dfs[a-z.]+' 

Don't forget to remove the output file after running a Job. Hadoop doesn't do this for you.

$ rm -rf output 
 
Now, to test the Genetic jar file:

$ export HADOOP_HOME=/home/renata/hadoop-1.2.1 
$ export HADOOP_VERSION=1.2.1 

To compile the code run :

$ javac -classpath ${HADOOP_HOME}/hadoop-core*.jar -d genetic_classes Genetic.java 

And create the jar:

$ jar -cvf genetic.jar -C genetic_classes/ .

Now, to run the code (once you put the input data on "input/" directory):

$ bin/hadoop jar genetic.jar org.myorg.Genetic input output
